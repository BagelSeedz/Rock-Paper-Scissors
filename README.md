# 3D Rock-Paper-Scissors

## About the Project

I started this project after coming across a basic rock-paper-scissors simulator and becoming entrhalled in it's beauty.

I wanted to recreate the idea in the third dimention to experiment with the behaviors of the opponents in comparison to 2D Rock-Paper-Scissors. My language of choice was Lua, in order to use the 3D space in ROBLOX Studio. 

## Results

I observed that in every simulation, the fighters eventually gravitate towards the center of their bounding cube and got closer to it as the number of it's prey got smaller.

I had fun :)
