# 3D Rock-Paper-Scissors
## Introduction
In the realm where decisions shape destinies, where ancient conflicts find respite in the hands of mere mortals, there exists a timeless contest known as "Rock, Paper, Scissors." A dance of fate, a struggle for supremacy, and a clash of elemental forces intertwine in this enigmatic battlefield.

Each move, a declaration of intent, a symphony of possibilities, and a glimpse into the soul of the strategist. In the midst of this cosmic dance, two opponents stand, eyes locked, hearts pounding, fingers poised to unveil their chosen destiny. With a primal roar, Rock meets Scissors in a cataclysmic collision, paper shrouds Rock in ephemeral victory, and Scissors dart forth to rend Paper asunder.

As the echo of each triumphant clash fades, the ebb and flow of the ages persist in the simple yet profound tapestry of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It is a reflection of the human spirit, a manifestation of the eternal struggle between strength, wit, and adaptability. In this microcosm of life's battles, only one can emerge victorious, while the others bow in humble acquiescence, awaiting the next chapter in this unending saga of chance and choice.

## About the Project

I started this project after coming across a basic rock-paper-scissors simulator and becoming entrhalled in it's beauty.

I wanted to recreate the idea in the third dimention to experiment with the behaviors of the opponents in comparison to 2D Rock-Paper-Scissors. My language of choice was Lua, in order to use the 3D space in ROBLOX Studio. 

## Results

I observed that in every simulation, the fighters eventually gravitate towards the center of their bounding cube and got closer to it as the number of it's prey got smaller.

I had fun :)
